<h1>Appeals</h1>
<p>Ursula uses multiple rhetorical devices to manipulate Ariel such as, appeals to ethos (credibility) - "That's what I do. It's what I live for." - this establishes her credibility as someone who is 'trustworthy' and knows what they are doing. Also, Ursula uses appeals to pathos (emotion/desire) - "This one longing to be thinner, that one wants to get the girl." - this appeals to Ariel's desure and triggers emotions that she can relate to. Lastly, Ursula uses appeals to logos (contracts) - "If you want to cross the bridge, you've got to pay the toll."  - she presents the deal/contract logically in order to manipulate Ariel and persuade the kingdom. Ursula's appeals are effective yet cunning.</p>
